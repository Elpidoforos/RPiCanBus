# RPiCanBus
This repository will keep the scripts which are developed for the purspose of the Elpidoforos Arapantonis MSc thesis in Information Security programe in Lule√• University of Technology. The developement board which the thesis is based upon is a Rarpberry Pi with a PICAN2 module. 

log_data.py : will run on the background upon start up and wait for input from a CAN Bus network. When a good amount of data are gathered then some packets will be alternated and refeed back to the bus in order to confuse/fuzz the receiving node.

There are 7 option which can be used:
        1.Capture CAN Bus traffic,
        2.Capture CAN Bus traffic and extract the Frame IDs,
        3.Capture Traffic and Replay on the CAN Bus with random CAN data,
        4.Replay Traffic from captured or random ID list (if ID list exist replay, otherwise generate IDs and replay),
        5.Persistent attack with random data (if ID list exist replay, otherwise generate IDs and replay),
        6.Restart the CAN Bus Interface and
        7.Exit/Quit

A log in the logfile.txt shall look like the snipset below:
Timestamp: 1525196535.167178        ID: 0123    S          DLC: 8    ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

*Timestamp : When the frame has been caught
*ID: The frame ID of the packet
*DLC: The size of the data frame
*The last field ff ff ff ff...  are the data of the frame.
